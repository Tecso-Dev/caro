/* The typed surface of `webapp/api/schemas.py`.
 *
 * These interfaces are hand-written rather than generated, and that is a real
 * cost: two hand-written descriptions of one contract drift, and TypeScript
 * validates this file against its own belief about the server — which is
 * precisely the belief that goes stale.
 *
 * So the duplication is checked instead of trusted. `tests/test_api_contract.py`
 * reads this file, extracts every interface's field names, and asserts they
 * are exactly the fields of the matching Pydantic model. Adding a field on one
 * side and not the other fails the suite rather than surfacing months later as
 * an `undefined` on a screen.
 *
 * Codegen would remove the duplication outright and is the better answer at a
 * larger size. It is not worth a build step for eleven interfaces, and the
 * check above closes the gap it would have closed.
 *
 * The one thing this file will not do is invent a fallback. If `/api/search`
 * is unreachable the caller gets a rejected promise and the page says the
 * backend is down — it does not quietly serve a fixture, because a screen that
 * cannot tell you where its numbers came from is the failure this whole
 * project is arguing against.

"""What a screen may draw, declared once, in code.

`docs/FIELD_PROVENANCE.md` states the same table in prose, measured against
the corpus the site serves by default. This module states it as data, and
`tests/test_corpus.py` asserts the two agree. Neither is derived from the
other, which is the point: a value written in one place and read in the other
is one declaration, and one declaration cannot disagree with itself.

WHY NOT PARSE THE DOCUMENT AND BE DONE

Because then the test would compare the document with itself and pass on
anything. The duplication is the guard. The same reasoning is in
`tests/test_claims.py`, which verifies a glob against an independent os.walk
rather than trusting the pattern that produced it.

THE FOUR FLAGS, AND WHY `filter` IS TWO OF THEM

    card    the grid may draw it
    detail  the listing page may draw it
    gate    the query applies it before a reader sees a row; nobody chooses it
    facet   a reader chooses it

A gate and a facet are both filters to a query engine and are not the same act.
`product_class` is the only gate — only `vehicle` renders as a car (D52) — and
it would fail a facet's variety condition, having two values. Collapsing them
into one flag is how a gate becomes a checkbox.

NONE OF THESE FOLLOW FROM COVERAGE

A field can be filled on every row and still be `facet=False`: `make` has one
distinct value on the served corpus, so a filter over it offers one choice.
Coverage and variety are inputs to the judgement, not the judgement.

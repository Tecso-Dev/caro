"""The contact inbox: one append-only file, and a token that fails closed.

Four properties, and each of them is a decision rather than an accident.

**It is not the corpus.** `data/inbox/` holds messages people chose to send us,
with the contact details they chose to give. That is categorically different
from a seller's phone number lifted out of an advertisement, which the data
contract forbids ever storing. The two must not share a directory, a lifecycle
or a guard: `data/corpora/` is published and scanned for contact identifiers,
this is neither published nor scanned. It is `.gitignore`d, and nothing in the
promotion path can read it.

**The admin endpoint fails closed.** With `CARO_ADMIN_TOKEN` unset there is no
token that opens it, rather than a default that does. An admin surface whose
lock is "the environment variable was not configured" is a surface with no
lock, and that mistake is invisible until it is not.

**Append-only, never a database.** A JSONL file is enough for a contact inbox
and it is honest about what it is. It also means a message cannot be silently
edited after the fact — the file grows, and what was written stays written.

**Off where the disk does not keep what is written.** A serverless function,
or a container without a volume, would accept a message, answer with a
reference, and lose the file — a receipt for nothing. Only the operator knows
which kind of disk a deployment has, so it is a setting: `CARO_INBOX=off`.
Then the inbox refuses with 503 and names a place where a message does stay.
With the setting absent the inbox is on, as it always was; and a write that
fails anyway is the same 503, never a 500 and never a reference.
